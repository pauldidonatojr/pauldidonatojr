My name is Paul I code mostly in Javascript. When I code frontend I will use React, Bootstrap, CSS3, CSS Frameworks(SASS, LESS, TAILWIND). If I am working on a backend I will be using node.js or php. I have knowledge of operating systems and computer hardware. I like to design frontend UI's. I am currently learning about blockchain by programming in solidity.
